# Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure

This is a monorepo for MACI, which provides the base layer for voting systems,
quadratic funding, and other applications which require collusion resistance.

Please refer to the [implementation
spec](./SPEC.md) for technical details, and the

# MACI
Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure

This project is based upon https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure

# Developing on MACI

MACI is tested with `node v10.16.3`

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Generate the circuits
yarn circuit:compile
yarn circuit:setup
yarn circuit:generateverifier

# Run Ganache (in another terminal)
yarn ganache

# Running tests
# NOTE: You'll need to have services running (eg ganache)
#       You can setup the services with `docker-compose up`
#       in another terminal
yarn test
```

# Deployment
